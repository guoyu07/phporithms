Classic sorting/math algorithms
=================================

Here is my sandbox to investigate my gaps with algorithms

Please, if you find a bug or you have a suggestion, feel free to contact me anytime! 

I also have plans to organize this repository as source code aka [Google style](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/google-2-billion-lines-codeand-one-place/)


Development:
`composer install`
`composer exec phpunit -v`

You might find repositories with java and c++ sources.

Only java might be build:
`gradle wrapper --gradle-version 2.13`
`./gradlew build`
